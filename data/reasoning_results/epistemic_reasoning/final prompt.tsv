This is a task to determine whether one sentence entails the next. We have input and output pairs, and have asked labeler give the reason for each output result. Given following data each contains input, output result and reason for the output, summerize a general reason for all these cases:\n\n
Cases for category: entailment 
Data point 1
Input: Premise: Charlotte thinks that two workers stretch the canvas of the advertising billboard for free range chickens to be appended on a billboard. Hypothesis: Charlotte thinks that two men work outdoors. 
Output: entailment
Reason: One possible reason why the output is entailment is- Entailment is a relation between two sentences where the truth of the first sentence (the premise) guarantees the truth of the second sentence (the hypothesis), regardless of the context or world knowledge.\n- In this case, the premise states that Charlotte thinks that two workers stretch the canvas of the advertising billboard for free range chickens. This implies that Charlotte has some mental representation of the two workers and their activity, which involves being outdoors and being men (assuming that the word workers is gendered in this context).\n- The hypothesis states that Charlotte thinks that two men work outdoors. This is a more general and less specific statement than the premise, but it is still compatible with it and does not contradict or introduce any new information that would make the premise false. Therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, and the output is entailment.

Data point 2
Input: Premise: Emma assumes that Abigail learns that a young boy giving his brother a piggyback ride. Hypothesis: Emma assumes that a young boy giving his brother a piggyback ride. 
Output: entailment
Reason: One possible reason why the output is entailment is based on the following definition of entailmentEntailment is a relation between two sentences where the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of the other, regardless of the context or world knowledge.\n\nIn this case, the premise sentence is a complex sentence that contains the hypothesis sentence as a subordinate clause. Therefore, if the premise sentence is true, then the hypothesis sentence must also be true, since it is part of the premise. The premise sentence does not add any additional information or condition that would make the hypothesis sentence false or uncertain. Thus, the premise entails the hypothesis.

Cases for category: non-entailment 
Data point 1
Input: Premise: Sophia understands that Amelia thinks that a bare chested smiling child plays in water. Hypothesis: Amelia thinks that Sophia understands that a bare chested smiling child plays in water. 
Output: non-entailment
Reason: One possible reason why the output is non-entailment is that the premise and the hypothesis have different subjects and objects of the verb understands. In the premise, Sophia is the subject and Amelia is the object, while in the hypothesis, Amelia is the subject and Sophia is the object. This means that the premise does not necessarily imply that the hypothesis is true, since it is possible that Amelia does not know what Sophia understands or that Sophia does not understand what Amelia thinks. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.

Data point 2
Input: Premise: David believes that Joseph believes that a member of a Bergwacht team leads a sled laden with orange material while on skis as his colleague stands in the foreground. Hypothesis: Joseph believes that a member of a Bergwacht team leads a sled laden with orange material while on skis as his colleague stands in the foreground. 
Output: non-entailment
Reason: One possible reason why the output is non-entailment is that the premise does not necessarily imply the hypothesis, even if it is consistent with it. That is, it is possible that David is mistaken or lying about what Joseph believes, or that Joseph has changed his mind or forgotten what he saw. Therefore, the hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise, and the relation is not entailment. Another way to think about it is that the hypothesis is more specific than the premise, and adds information that is not given or guaranteed by the premise. Therefore, the relation is not entailment.
