This is a task to determine whether one sentence entails the next. We have input and output pairs, and have asked labeler give the reason for each output result. Given following data each contains input, output result and reason for the output, summerize a general reason for all these cases:\n\n
Cases for category: entailment 
Data point 1
Input: Premise: Amelia believes that Michael knows that a woman is in the middle of hitting a tennis ball. Hypothesis: Amelia believes that a woman is in the middle of hitting a tennis ball. 
Output: entailment
Reason: One possible reason why the output is entailment is based on the following logical argument- If Amelia believes that Michael knows that a woman is in the middle of hitting a tennis ball, then Amelia must also believe that a woman is in the middle of hitting a tennis ball. This is because believing that someone knows something implies believing that something is true.\n- Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis, since the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise.\n- Entailment is a relation between sentences where the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another sentence, regardless of the context or the world knowledge.

Data point 2
Input: Premise: Ava assumes that a child stands in a shower with clothes on. Hypothesis: Ava assumes that a clothed child is in the shower. 
Output: entailment
Reason: One possible reason why the output is entailment is- Entailment is a logical relation between two sentences, where the truth of the first sentence (premise) guarantees the truth of the second sentence (hypothesis), regardless of the context or world knowledge.\n- In this case, the premise states that Ava assumes a specific situation: a child stands in a shower with clothes on. The hypothesis is a more general statement that follows from the premise: Ava assumes that a clothed child is in the shower. \n- The hypothesis does not add any new information or contradict the premise, but rather simplifies or paraphrases it. Therefore, if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true, and entailment holds.

Cases for category: non-entailment 
Data point 1
Input: Premise: Taylor suspects that Charlotte believes that a man in a red shirt is sitting on top of a rocky mountain. Hypothesis: Charlotte believes that a man in a red shirt is sitting on top of a rocky mountain. 
Output: non-entailment
Reason: One possible reason why the output is non-entailment is that the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, even if it is consistent with it. The premise only states what Taylor suspects, not what Charlotte actually believes. It is possible that Taylor is wrong, or that Charlotte has changed her mind, or that she has some other evidence that contradicts the hypothesis. Therefore, the hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise, and the relation is non-entailment.

Data point 2
Input: Premise: David recognizes that Richard believes that male wearing brown shorts and black t-shirt in his bedroom with his feet on the desk talking on the phone. Hypothesis: Richard believes that David recognizes that male wearing brown shorts and black t-shirt in his bedroom with his feet on the desk talking on the phone. 
Output: non-entailment
Reason: One possible reason why the output is non-entailment is that the premise does not provide enough evidence to support the hypothesis. The premise only states that David recognizes what Richard believes, but it does not imply that Richard is aware of David's recognition. It is possible that Richard does not know that David has access to his bedroom, or that David can see or hear him talking on the phone. Therefore, the hypothesis is not necessarily true based on the premise, and the relation is non-entailment.
